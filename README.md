🩺 **Health Prognosis System**

A Health Prognosis System built using Machine Learning, Python (Flask), and NoSQL Database. The project predicts health conditions from patient data, enabling early detection and better medical decisions.

📌 **About the Project**

This project was designed to explore predictive healthcare analytics. It applies machine learning models for prognosis and integrates them into a user-friendly Flask web application with a NoSQL backend for scalable and efficient storage.

✨ **Features**

Patient data input and management

Machine Learning–based prediction of health conditions

Flask web interface for interaction

Secure and scalable data storage (NoSQL)

Research-driven approach with literature survey and methodology

🛠 **Technologies Used**

Python (core development & ML models)

Flask (web framework)

NoSQL Database (MongoDB / similar)

Machine Learning Algorithms (classification & prediction models)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend UI)

🏗 **System Architecture**

The system consists of:

Frontend: Flask + HTML/CSS/JS for patient input & results display

Backend: Python ML models integrated with Flask APIs

Database: NoSQL for scalable health data storage

Security: Authentication & privacy requirements considered
